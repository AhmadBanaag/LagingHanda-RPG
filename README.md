🛡️ LAGING HANDA
A Turn-Based RPG of Philippine Myth and Destiny

Laging Handa is a Java + GUI, story-driven, turn-based RPG inspired by classic Pokémon mechanics — but instead of cute creatures, you face the dark, powerful beings of Philippine mythology. Build your strength, strategize your moves, and confront ancient monsters born from folklore and fear.

In this world, every battle is a test of courage.
Every choice pushes you closer to becoming the hero fate demands.

🌏 Story Overview

The world is shifting.
An ancient force has awakened beneath the islands — a power older than memory, older than myth itself. You are chosen, not by destiny, but by necessity, to confront the chaos rising from the shadows.

Armed with courage, instinct, and the will to survive, you must face the creatures of legend and uncover the truth behind the disturbance threatening the land.

In the world of the supernatural, only one mantra matters: Laging Handa.
Always prepared.
