## 🛡️ LAGING HANDA 

A **Turn-Based RPG** of Philippine *Myth* and *Destiny*

Laging Handa is a Java + GUI, story-driven, turn-based RPG inspired by classic **Pokémon** mechanics, 
but instead of cute creatures, you face the dark, powerful beings of Philippine mythology. 
Build your strength, strategize your moves, and confront ancient monsters born from folklore and fear.

**In this world, every battle is a test of courage.
Every choice pushes you closer to becoming the *hero* fate demands.**
