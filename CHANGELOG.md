### Devlog #1 (12-5-2025) - Beginning

## What will the game be all about?
- I will be creating an rpg-turn based game based on some philippine mytholigical creatures. A story about a boy scoutt that don't believe on mythological creatures or aswang but will face the wrath of some monsters because seeing is believing. 

- I don't have a storyline for the game but I think I will just with some battle mechanics without any GUI, just the CLI first.

## Battle Mechanics (v1) 
- The player will start the game and will encounter different types of aswangs with different attributes. 
- The player can attack, heal, or run. When ATTACKING, player can pick 12 spells based on the scout law. This spells will do significant damage on a monster but depending on what the monster will be. Like how fire beats grass type shi. 
- The Player can also heal, but has 2 potions only that is also luck based and can only add 10 hp to 20 hp depending on his/her luck.
- You may run to face the next stage but you can only run twice. Like just skipping a level basically but it is also luck based.
- They make pick a LAW/SPELL and the attack will basically will be luck-based. So, attributes matter but there will be random hits or damage to the monster. 
- The monster on the other hand can also attack or heal and its action is also luck based. 
- If you win, you will be healed and proceed to the next level. 

## Stages

- 5 Stages? Leading to a boss level. That's it
- Different difficulty on each level, just basically upping the hp level of a monster and their luck is higher than before.

- END OF LOG -
